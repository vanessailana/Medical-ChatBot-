        "Reduce data noise: Tokenization involves breaking down text into individual words or subwords. This process removes unnecessary data such as punctuation marks, extra spaces, and other special characters, which could cause noise and negatively affect the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encode input data: Machine learning models work on numerical data. Tokenization allows us to convert text data into numerical representations such as vectors, which can be easily processed by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preserve semantic meaning: Tokenization not only encodes words numerically but also takes into account their context. This helps preserve the semantic meaning of the original text and enables the model to understand the relationships between words in a sentence.\n",
