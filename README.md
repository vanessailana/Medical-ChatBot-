### Medical Chatbot using ClinicalBERT and GPT-2
This project is aimed at creating a medical chatbot that can interact with patients, answer their health-related queries, and provide them with personalized medical advice. The chatbot will be built using two of the most advanced natural language processing (NLP) models - ClinicalBERT and GPT-2.

Introduction
The use of chatbots in healthcare has been growing rapidly over the past few years. They can provide patients with quick and convenient access to medical information, help them schedule appointments, and even provide therapy for mental health issues.

This project aims to build a medical chatbot that can assist patients in real-time by providing them with relevant and accurate medical advice. The chatbot will be trained on a large dataset of medical texts to ensure that it can handle a wide range of queries from patients.

Technology Used
This project uses two state-of-the-art NLP models - ClinicalBERT and GPT-2.

ClinicalBERT is a pre-trained language model that has been specifically trained on clinical notes and medical texts. It has been shown to outperform other pre-trained language models on a range of clinical NLP tasks.

GPT-2, on the other hand, is a generative language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of web pages. It is capable of generating human-like text and can be fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks.
